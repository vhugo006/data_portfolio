# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This repository contains code and resources for building a model to prevent credit card frauds using a dataset of credit card transactions made by European cardholders in the year 2023.

## Problem Description

Credit card fraud is a significant concern for both cardholders and financial institutions. The objective of this project is to develop a fraud detection algorithm or model that can accurately identify potentially fraudulent transactions. 

By analyzing patterns and characteristics of fraudulent transactions, we aim to build a model that can effectively detect and prevent credit card frauds.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains over 550,000 credit card transactions made by European cardholders in the year 2023. The data has been anonymized to protect the identities of the cardholders. 

Each transaction record includes various features such as transaction amount, transaction time, and anonymized features derived from the transaction data.

The dataset is provided in CSV format and can be found in the `data` directory of this repository. It is recommended to explore the dataset and understand its structure before proceeding with the model development.

The Kaggle url of the dataset is: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/credit-card-fraud-detection-dataset-2023/

## Model Development

To build the fraud detection model, we will utilize various machine learning techniques and algorithms. 

We're going to compare different algorithms, tune them and choose the best one based on the metrics.
